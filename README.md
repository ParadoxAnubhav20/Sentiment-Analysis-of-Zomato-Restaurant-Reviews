# Sentiment Analysis of Zomato Restaurant Reviews

## Overview
This repository contains an analysis focused on predicting the sentiment (positive or negative) of restaurant reviews from the Zomato dataset. By leveraging various predictive algorithms including Multinomial Naive Bayes, Bernoulli Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machine, the goal is to build an effective prediction model.

## Purpose
The main objective of this analysis is to develop a robust prediction model that accurately determines whether a given restaurant review holds a positive or negative sentiment.

## Dataset
The analysis employs the Restaurant Review dataset obtained from Zomato. This dataset serves as the foundation for training and testing the predictive models.

## Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing:** The raw data from the Zomato dataset is prepared for analysis by cleaning, organizing, and structuring it appropriately.
2. **Feature Engineering:** Relevant features are extracted from the dataset, transforming raw data into a format suitable for model training.
3. **Predictive Algorithms:** The following algorithms are employed to build prediction models:
   - Multinomial Naive Bayes
   - Bernoulli Naive Bayes
   - Logistic Regression
   - Support Vector Machine
4. **Model Training:** Each predictive algorithm is applied to the preprocessed dataset, enabling the models to learn the relationships between features and sentiment labels.
5. **Model Evaluation:** The performance of each model is assessed using appropriate evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
6. **Model Comparison:** A comparative analysis of the models' performance helps identify the most effective approach for sentiment prediction.

## Expected Outcome
Through this analysis, we anticipate identifying the most suitable predictive model for sentiment analysis of Zomato restaurant reviews. The selected model should offer high accuracy in distinguishing between positive and negative sentiments in these reviews.

## Conclusion
By the end of this analysis, we aim to uncover insights into sentiment trends within Zomato restaurant reviews and provide a reliable predictive model for sentiment classification.
